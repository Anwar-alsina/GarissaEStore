# GarissaEStore
An Android Application for an E-Commerce App in Garissa.

## Approach ##
### Architecture 
This app has a MultiModule, Model View Intent(MVI) architecture in place to allow the App to **Scale**, improve Quality and Robustness and Allow the App to Scale.
Better separation of concern that leads to easier maintainability.

This App uses Clean Architecture to ensure:

- State management using immutability to have a single source of truth.
- Unidirectional data flow
- reproducible state -> simple code reuse
- Make Code easier to read
- better separation of concern -> maintainability


## Libraries used

- **Retrofit** - Android Network Client, Used to consume API from Fakestore Api
- **AirBnB Epoxy** - Epoxy is an Android library for building complex screens in a RecyclerView. Models are automatically generated from custom views or databinding layouts via annotation processing. These models are then used in an EpoxyController to declare what items to show in the RecyclerView.
- **Coroutines** - Used to execute code asynchronously
- **Material Design + XML** - Used to write the UI of the App
- **Material Design** - Give the App a theme and generally improve UI of the App
- **Coil Image** - Image Loading library
- **Lifecycle library** - Majorly to define the ViewModels of the app
- **Navigation** - To navigate to different screens of the App
